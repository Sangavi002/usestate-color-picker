# Interactive-Colour:

The application validates the input field to ensure it's a valid HEX color code and displays an error message if it's not.

 Key observations regarding React's event handling and state management mechanisms in the code:

Event Handling: React's onChange event is used to handle changes in the input value in real-time.

State Management: React's useState hook manages the current color value (val) and validation status (isValid).

Conditional Rendering: Error messages are conditionally rendered based on the isValid state variable.

Styling: Inline styling is used to style elements within the application.

React Root: ReactDOM.createRoot is used to create a root for the React application, and render method is called to render the App component within this root.

Overall, the code demonstrates a functional color picker application with clean implementation using React's features.
